I was going through my Flipboard magazines I have been creating since August 2017 (but never read!), and start the filter out some of the article with the aim to really read and understand the articles this time round. So here goes a list of interesting articles I have found over the years. Hopefully the list will become more relevant once the backlog has been cleared.

* [Pattern: Service Mesh](http://philcalcado.com/2017/08/03/pattern_service_mesh.html)

The article explains the ideas behind a service mesh, but interestingly shows how components in distributed software has evolved over time. The article explains the relevance of a service mesh as it pertains to a microservices architecture, but the idea could be applied across any architecture. The return on investment (less components in non microservices architecture) might be less, but the service mesh pattern will benefit most architectures with some sort of interaction with other components.

> A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication. Itâ€™s responsible for the reliable delivery of requests through the complex topology of services that comprise a modern, cloud native application. In practice, the service mesh is typically implemented as an array of lightweight network proxies that are deployed alongside application code, without the application needing to be aware.
