Books list of books read or planning to read in 2019


  
## January 2019

* [Anthem](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anthem-Ayn-Rand/dp/1984922963/) by [Ayn Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand)

Ayn Rand was introduced into the Prometheus Award Hall of Fame inductee in 1987 for Anthem, so a well known book. Honestly did not enjoy the book as much as I thought I would (ignoring Ayn Rand's politics of course). All a bit to simple and short. The idea feels forced on the reader, as opposed to developing as the book progresses. Maybe my own bias kicking in

* [The Bricks that Built the Houses](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01BC3L14M/ref=oh_aui_d_asin_title_o01_?ie=UTF8&psc=1) by [Kate Tempest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Tempest)

Engaging story with interesting twists and turns. The writing is incredibly descriptive and almost poetic in some places. Taking the words and having listenend to her music, the story just flows. Enjoyed the fact that the book was set in London, you could almost hear the South London accents. 

> On a side note, I recommend listening to [Kate Tempest's](https://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Tempest) [music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1O3wYcUD08X9yb6J3xaw5M?si=QEXYnLlFStay3VGzV7iDmw).
