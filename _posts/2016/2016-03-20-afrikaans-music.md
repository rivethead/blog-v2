Watched ["Dis ek, Anna"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4417520/) last week. Not a light-hearted film, but worth the watch. Definitely worth a watch. Go and watch it.

As good as the movie was, what really caught my attention was the music used in the film. Or more specifically John Blohm's Breyten Se Brief. A good friend gave me a Jan Blohm album years ago, but to my embarrassment I did not really listen to the album at all. A bit of a wasted opportunity if you ask me. The music is brilliant. I appreciate / like / love music that stirs something in you when you listen to the music. And if it sounds good on headphones, even better!

So this made me think about Afrikaans music in general. Just to clarify, I am not talking about Kurt Darren etc, talking more about Afrikaans music that does not get played on radio on a regular basis. Yes, I sound like a snob. Anyway, there are some excellent / wonderful Afrikaans music out there that seem to fall through the cracks due to lack of interest or just lack of exposure. It is worth noting that the same argument applies to South African music in general. Some much good music out there. 

So here is a short list of Afrikaans music I think is worth listening to. Ok I am old, and I really don't follow music in general as much as I should and used to!

I am sure there a thousand other Afrikaans songs worth listening to, and I am very sure I will return to this list and add some more songs.

I really enjoyed putting this list together. Just so little time to listen to all this music.
